Any players other than those from the list will not be legible for playing
2. Users are required to guess the next number from a shuffle of numbers between 1 and 36 inclusive. Besides users can just guess that the next number will be ODD or EVEN.
Therefore the choices are an integer  from 1...36 OR EVEN OR ODD
3. A player can play as many times as he can, as long as he does not repsond by Q. Q, will end the game and start shuffling integers producing results in every 30 seconds
